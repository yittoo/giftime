### This is a small script I wrote for a problem we had with gif durations on a client's website

Neither us or the client knew the exact milisecond length of the gif we wanted to use and we needed it for perfect looping.

How to use:

- Throw gifs that you want to measure length of near main.go
- go run main.go -i filename
- Output will be in terms of miliseconds
